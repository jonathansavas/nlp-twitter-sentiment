# Marist-NLP-Project

We built a Twitter sentiment model using an LSTM neural network in Tensorflow and Keras in order to assign positivity ratings to tweets. We used these ratings to create a plot of team sentiment over the course of a game. We compared this against a win probability plot for that team over the course of the same game to see if we could capture the changes in a team's performance throughout the game based on tweets. 

We utilized Tweepy (https://www.tweepy.org/) to grab our text data from Twitter. For our training data, we used the Sentiment140 dataset (http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/), a file of 1.6 million tweets from Stanford University, classified as positive or negative. We also leveraged GloVe pre-trained Twitter word-vectors (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), to create an initial Embedding layer in our model. To get the win probability data, we used the nflscrapR library (https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) combined with rpy2 (https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/) to call this directly from Python. Finally, we used nflgame (https://github.com/derek-adair/nflgame) to create files which linked game-time timestamps to real-time timestamps.
