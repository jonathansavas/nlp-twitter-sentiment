## Description
Can we find a correlation between how an NFL team is perceived and their win percentages during a game? We want to perform a sentiment analysis on each NFL team during a game and use statistitcs generated from ESPN as a real time win percentages to find correlations. Two end goals for this would be to figure out if we can predict the outcome of a game based on sentiment analysis throughout the game, and if we can predict a teams chance to win only by the fan perception. 
## Steps to Completion
- Scrape twitter for specific hashtag's to get live data
- Scrape ESPN or other sport stastical data. 
- Perform a sentiment analysis on the tweets. 
- Create a regression model using sentiment as a feature to predict outcomes and real time win chance.
